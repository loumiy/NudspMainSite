# NudspMainSite
Delta Sigma Pi - Sigma Omega chapter's main website.  
  
Welcome to the code base for our website! Here you will find all the components that make up our site. Should you need to see any old commits, or to just review the progress of the project in general, look at previous commits! If you are assisting in the development of the site in any capacity please be sure to branch out of master for any changes. All changes will be reviewed by the webmaster and approved (or rejected, yikes..hope not) and merged into the main branch. Thanks! :smiley:

## Branch Naming Conventions
If you are creating a branch, please use the following naming convention:  
  
First your name, then include the type of change the branch will be dedicated to, and finally a very small description.  
    Branch types:    
    **crte** - Creating basic functionality, used in key site development  
    **bug** - Fixing some sort of bug  
    **feat** - Adding a feature to the current site  
    **junk** - Experimental throw away branch  
    **wip** - Like a feature, but with an undetermined deliver date  
    **remv** - Removal of some large part of the current site. Branch to protect from potential fallout  
   
 An example: kirk/bug/brokennavlink
